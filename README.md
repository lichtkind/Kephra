Kephra - programmers writing assistant

VERSION

SYNOPSIS
========

Kephra is in its fourth rewrite and I still work on the foundations (KBOS).
So not much to see here.
All of the work happens in /dev  because i follow the CP methodology.
The goal is to get more than an editor but an intelligent programming environment
that is not bloatet, but supports you in all tasks surrounding a software project.
