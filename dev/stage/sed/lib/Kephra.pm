=head2 use-ing Chart

Okay, so you caught me.  There's really no Chart::type module.
All of the different chart types (Points, Lines, Bars, LinesPoints,
Composite, StackedBars, Pie, Pareto, HorizontalBars, Split, ErrorBars,
Direction and Mountain so far) are classes by themselves, each inheriting 
a bunch of methods from the Chart::Base class.  Simply replace
the word type with the type of chart you want and you're on your way.  
For example,

  use Chart::Lines;

would invoke the lines module.
Alternatively load all chart types at ones and write:

  use Chart;

=head2 Getting an object

The new method can either be called without arguments, in which
case it returns an object with the default image size (400x300 pixels),
or you can specify the width and height of the image.  Just remember
to replace type with the type of graph you want.  For example,

  $obj = Chart::Bars->new (600,400);

would return a Chart::Bars object containing a 600x400 pixel
image.  New also initializes most of the default variables, which you 
can subsequently change with the set method.


=head2 Setting different options

This is where the fun begins.  Set looks for a hash of keys and
values.  You can pass it a hash that you've already constructed, like

  %hash = ( property_name => 'new value' );
  $obj->set (%hash);

or you can try just constructing the hash inside the set call, like

  $obj->set ( property_name => 'new value' );


L<Chart::Manual::Properties> lists all currently supported keys and values.


=head2 GIFgraph.pm-style API

=over 4

=item Sending the image to a file

Invoking the png method causes the graph to be plotted and saved to 
a file.  It takes the name of the output file and a reference to the
data as arguments.  For example,

  $obj->png ("foo.png", \@data);

would plot the data in @data, and the save the image to foo.png.
Of course, this then beggars the question "What should @data look
like?".  Well, just like GIFgraph, @data should contain references
to arrays of data, with the first array reference pointing to an
array of x-tick labels.  For example,

  @data = ( [ 'foo', 'bar', 'junk' ],
        [ 30.2,  23.5,  92.1   ] );

would set up a graph with one dataset, and three data points in that
set.  In general, the @data array should look something like

  @data = ( \@x_tick_labels, \@dataset1, ... , \@dataset_n );

And no worries, I make my own internal copy of the data, so that it doesn't
mess with yours.

=item CGI and Chart

Okay, so you're probably thinking, "Do I always have to save these images
to disk?  What if I want to use Chart to create dynamic images for my
web site?"  Well, here's the answer to that.

  $obj->cgi_png ( \@data );

The cgi_png method will print the chart, along with the appropriate http
header, to stdout, allowing you to call chart-generating scripts directly
from your html pages (ie. with a <lt>img src=image.pl<gt> HTML tag).  The @data
array should be set up the same way as for the normal png method.

=back

=head2 column based API

You might ask, "But what if I just want to add a few points to the graph, 
and then display it, without all those references to references?".  Well,
friend, the solution is simple.  Borrowing the add_pt idea from Matt
Kruse's Graph module, you simply make a few calls to the add_pt method,
like so:

    $obj->add_pt ('foo', 30, 25);
    $obj->add_pt ('bar', 16, 32);

Or, if you want to be able to add entire datasets, simply use the add_dataset
method:

    $obj->add_dataset ('foo', 'bar');
    $obj->add_dataset (30, 16);
    $obj->add_dataset (25, 32);

These methods check to make sure that the points and datasets you are
adding are the same size as the ones already there.  So, if you have
two datasets currently stored, and try to add a data point with three
different values, it will carp (per the Carp module) an error message.
Similarly, if you try to add a dataset with 4 data points,
and all the other datasets have 3 data points, it will carp an error
message.

Don't forget, when using this API, that I treat the first dataset as
a series of x-tick labels.  So, in the above examples, the graph would
have two x-ticks, labeled 'foo' and 'bar', each with two data points.
Pie and ErrorBars handle it different, look at the documentation
to see how it works.

=over 4

=item Adding a datafile

You can also add a complete datafile to a chart object. Just use the
add_datafile() method.

    $obj->add_datafile('file', 'set' or 'pt');

file can be the name of the data file or a filehandle. 
'set' or 'pt is the type of the datafile. 
If the parameter is 'set' then each line in the data file
has to be a complete data set. The value of the set has to be 
separated by white spaces. For example the file looks like this:

    'foo'  'bar'
    30     16
    25     32

If the parameter is 'pt', one line has to include all values
of one data point separated by white spaces. For example:

    'foo'  30  25
    'bar'  16  32


=item Clearing the data

A simple call to the clear_data method empties any values that may
have been entered.

    $obj->clear_data ();

=item Getting a copy of the data

If you want a copy of the data that has been added so far, make a call
to the get_data method like so:

        $dataref = $obj->get_data;

It returns (you guessed it!) a reference to an array of references to
datasets.  So the x-tick labels would be stored as

        @x_labels = @{$dataref->[0]};

=item Sending the image to a file

If you just want to print this chart to a file, all you have to do
is pass the name of the file to the png() method.

    $obj->png ("foo.png");

=item Sending the image to a filehandle

If you want to do something else with the image, you can also pass
a filehandle (either a typeglob or a FileHandle object) to png, and
it will print directly to that.

    $obj->png ($filehandle);
    $obj->png (FILEHANDLE);


=item CGI and Chart

Okay, so you're probably thinking (again), "Do I always have to save these 
images to disk?  What if I want to use Chart to create dynamic images for
my web site?"  Well, here's the answer to that.

    $obj->cgi_png ();

The cgi_png method will print the chart, along with the appropriate http
header, to stdout, allowing you to call chart-generating scripts directly
from your html pages (ie. with a <lt>img src=image.pl<gt> HTML tag). 


=item Produce a png image as a scalar

Like scalar_jpeg() the image is produced as a scalar
so that the programmer-user can do whatever the heck
s/he wants to with it:

    $obj-scalar_png($dataref)



=item Produce a jpeg image as a scalar

Like scalar_png() the image is produced as a scalar
so that the programmer-user can do whatever the heck
s/he wants to with it:

    $obj-scalar_jpeg($dataref)
    
=back

=head2 Imagemap Support

Chart can also return the pixel positioning information so that you can
create image maps from the pngs Chart generates.  Simply set the 'imagemap'
option to 'true' before you generate the png, then call the imagemap_dump()
method afterwards to retrieve the information.  You will be returned a
data structure almost identical to the @data array described above to pass
the data into Chart.

    $imagemap_data = $obj->imagemap_dump ();

Instead of single data values, you will be passed references to arrays
of pixel information.  For Bars, HorizontalBars and StackedBars charts, 
the arrays will contain two x-y pairs (specifying the upper left and 
lower right corner of the bar), like so

    ( $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2 ) = @{ $imagemap_data->[$dataset][$datapoint] };

For Lines, Points, ErrorBars, Split and LinesPoints, the arrays will contain 
a single x-y pair (specifying the center of the point), like so

    ( $x, $y ) = @{ $imagemap_data->[$dataset][$datapoint] };

A few caveats apply here.  First of all, GD treats the upper-left corner
of the png as the (0,0) point, so positive y values are measured from the
top of the png, not the bottom.  Second, these values will most likely
contain long decimal values.  GD, of course, has to truncate these to 
single pixel values.  Since I don't know how GD does it, I can't truncate
it the same way he does.  In a worst-case scenario, this will result in
an error of one pixel on your imagemap.  If this is really an issue, your
only option is to either experiment with it, or to contact Lincoln Stein
and ask him.  Third, please remember that the 0th dataset will be empty,
since that's the place in the @data array for the data point labels.


=head1 PLAN

This module is currently under a complete rebuild, that will take place 
in two phases. First: rewrite all functionality within a modular
architecture and hierarchical property system. This will be accessed
via a central API using the so far unutilized Chart module
'my $c = Chart->new(...);'. This API will have in part different 
method and property names, but the old API will not be touched.
In a second phase we will see hoch much new code can be used by the old
modules and which new features can be brought to the legacy parts,
which will be than discouraged, but not scrapped.


=head1 TO DO
