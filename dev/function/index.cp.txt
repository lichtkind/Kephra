functional prototypes are very small programs that check a set of related calls.
They are the testing ground for API we use. Only when we master an API 
and it can provide whats needed - further dev stages make sense.

More details about our development model are at doc/CompleteProgramming.pod
and about the relation of the different protos under dev/roadmap.txt
